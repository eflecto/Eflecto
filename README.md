# ⚡ Hello, I'm Eflecto – Electronics Engineer 

**"Turning circuits into solutions… and occasionally into smoke."**  

### 🔧 **What I Do**  
- Design **PCBs** like digital art (but with more solder).  
- Write **firmware** that makes microcontrollers question their existence.  
- Turn coffee into **embedded systems** (and sometimes into regret).  
- Generate **wild engineering ideas**—some brilliant, some… *flammable*.
- Use neural networks to write my READMEs... *wait, how did you notice)??*   

### 🛠️ **Skills**  
- **PCB Design:** KiCad, Altium (and prayers to the solder gods).  
- **Embedded Systems:** C/C++, ESP32, RTOS, *"why is this GPIO floating?"* debugging.  
- **3D Modeling:** COMPASS-3D, Fusion 360 (for when hardware needs *drip*).  
- **Other:** Radiation measurements, Sci-Fi weapon concepts (*purely academic… or is it?*).  

### 🚀 **Current Projects**  
- ☢️ **Radiation-Sensing Drone** – For when you *really* need to check your backyard.  
- 💣 **Jinx Grenade 3D Model** – Because even engineers need fun.  
- 📚 **Passing Finals at FTI** – *The ultimate boss fight.*
